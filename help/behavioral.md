Behavioral Design
=================

Workbench comes with two behavioral designers:

-	[Nodal](nodal) - The nodal designer allows users to graphically design systems using the nodal formalism described by Yin et al. 2008, and focuses on behavior and geometry.
-	[Pepper](pepper) - The Pepper compiler uses a powerful, text-based input formal for designing arbitrary strand-displacement systems
