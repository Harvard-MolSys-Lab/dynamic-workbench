Customization
=============

Workbench includes a documented [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript/) API which you can use to extend the built-in capabilities, perform custom processing, or modify the default behavior of applications. There are two main ways to do this:

* Console - You can execute arbitrary Javascript within the context of the active Workbench [Application](application) using the console.
* Custom scripts - You can write and execute complete Javascript programs from within Workbench. This is most useful for complicated workflows which need to be automated.


Console
-------

You can also run small snippets of code within a particular application, using the Workbench console. 

To open the console:

* From the main menu, select 'Tools', then 'Console'.
* Enter your code in the console window which appears at the lower right.

Custom scripts
--------------

You can use a custom script to write and execute a Javascript program within Workbench; this allows you access to all of the programmatic tools that Workbench provides, while letting you automate complicated or repetitive behavior. 

To build a custom script:

* [Create](files) a new Javascript file. 
* Open the file and enter your script.
* Click 'run' to execute your script.
