<h1 id="customization">Customization</h1>
<p>Workbench includes a documented <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript/">Javascript</a> API which you can use to extend the built-in capabilities, perform custom processing, or modify the default behavior of applications. There are two main ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Console - You can execute arbitrary Javascript within the context of the active Workbench <a href="application">Application</a> using the console.</li>
<li>Custom scripts - You can write and execute complete Javascript programs from within Workbench. This is most useful for complicated workflows which need to be automated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="console">Console</h2>
<p>You can also run small snippets of code within a particular application, using the Workbench console.</p>
<p>To open the console:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the main menu, select 'Tools', then 'Console'.</li>
<li>Enter your code in the console window which appears at the lower right.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="custom-scripts">Custom scripts</h2>
<p>You can use a custom script to write and execute a Javascript program within Workbench; this allows you access to all of the programmatic tools that Workbench provides, while letting you automate complicated or repetitive behavior.</p>
<p>To build a custom script:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="files">Create</a> a new Javascript file.</li>
<li>Open the file and enter your script.</li>
<li>Click 'run' to execute your script.</li>
</ul>
