<h1 id="dynamic-nucleic-acid-markup-language-dynaml">DyNAMiC Nucleic Acid Markup Language (DyNAML)</h1>
<p>The DyNAMiC Nucleic Acid Markup Language (DyNAML) is the natural input langauge to DyNAMiC---the primary behavioral compiler associated with Workbench. DyNAML allows you to specify high-level behavioral functions using a simple text-based markup language. DyNAML is a subset of <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>---the Javascript Object Notation. DyNAML documents are called libraries; each library contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of motifs --- templates for nodal species</li>
<li>A collection of nodes --- individual behavioral units that will be translated to real DNA strands</li>
<li>A set of parameters which guide formation of the final design.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full DyNAML language is described in <a href="/etc/papers/nodal.pdf">this whitepaper</a>. This document describes only the &quot;Short notation&quot; used several places within Workbench.</p>
<h2 id="short-notation">Short notation</h2>
<p><em>Short notation</em> allows you to abbreviate longer blocks of DyNAML code using single strings. Most commonly this is used to describe the domain- and segment-makeup of a strand. The following example illustrates the features of DyNAML short notation.</p>
<p>This string in DyNAML short notation...</p>
<pre><code>A[a:t b c(4)]i+ B[d c* b*:t]o-</code></pre>
<p>...is equivalent to the following string of full DyNAML:</p>
<pre><code>[
    {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A&quot;,
        &quot;segments&quot;: [
            {

                &quot;role&quot;: &quot;toehold&quot;
            },
            {
                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;b&quot;
            },
            {

        ],

    {

        &quot;segments&quot;: [

                &quot;role&quot;: &quot;toehold&quot;
            }
        ],
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;output&quot;,
        &quot;polarity&quot;: &quot;-&quot;

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Brackets are used to group segments into domains. A name for the domain should appear immediately before the brackets. Names need not be a single-letter.</li>
<li>Within the brackets should be a space-separated list of segments. Segment names need not be letters. Complements of a particular segment identity can be indicated with a * or a '. The <em>role</em> of a segment can be indicated by adding colon and a role specifier after the segment name. The valid role specifiers are:
<ul>
<li><code>t</code> or <code>toehold</code> - Represents a toehold segment</li>
<li><code>c</code> or <code>clamp</code> - Represents a short &quot;clamp&quot; segment, designed to prevent leakage by exposure of sequestered toeholds during transient breathing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The length of segments will be automatically inferred from their role. The length can also be specified explicitly using parenthesis. If a role specifier is needed, this should be added after the length.</li>
<li>The <em>role</em> of domains follow the bracketed list. The following role specifiers are allowed for domains:
<ul>
<li><code>i</code> or <code>input</code> for input domains â€“ domains which contain exposed toeholds, such that binding causes branch migration which exposes some number of sequestered toeholds in other domains.</li>
<li><code>o</code> or <code>output</code> for output domains - domains whose toeholds, when exposed, bind to input domains and participate in branch migration reactions</li>
<li><code>b</code> or <code>bridge</code> for bridge domains - domains which bind to other exposed bridge domains, but do not participate in branch migration</li>
<li><code>x</code> or <code>structural</code> for structural domains - domains which do not bind to other exposed domains and only serve to allow the meta-stable form of a node to adopt a particular configuration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> sign can be used to indicate the &quot;relative polarity&quot; of a domain. This is used to indicate whether domains on downstream nodes need to be flipped to connect to this port. By convention, domains with 5' toeholds are labeled <code>+</code> and domains with 3' toeholds are labeled <code>-</code>.
<ul>
<li>For example: if a node with an input domain has a 5' toehold and another node with an ouput domain has a 3' output toehold, the two can be connected together properly and the strands will be antiparallel. However, if the output node had a 5' toehold, the node containing the output port would need to be &quot;flipped&quot; in order to be connected with the input port. In the first case, the input domain would be <code>+</code> and the output domain <code>-</code>. In the second case, both domains would be <code>+</code>. The polarity of <em>nodes</em> (e.g. whether they must be flipped) is determined by DyNAMiC, but relative polarities of ports must be specified by the motif designer.</li>
<li>For domains without polarities, the <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> can be omitted, or can be replaced with a <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
