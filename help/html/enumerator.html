<h1 id="domain-level-reaction-enumeration">Domain-level reaction enumeration</h1>
<p><em>Reaction enumeration</em> is the process of calculating all possible reactions between, and intermediate complexes formed, from an initial set of complexes. The process proceeds essentially as follows: we beginning with a pool of starting complexes, then calculate all possible &quot;fast&quot; (unimolecular) reactions within this pool. Any complexes (or cycles of complexes) without any outgoing &quot;fast&quot; reactions is deemed a &quot;resting complex;&quot; all other species are designated &quot;transient&quot; Subsequently, &quot;slow&quot; (bimolecular or higher-arity) reactions are then computed between these resting complexes. In DyNAMiC, this process is performed between <em>domains</em> (known elsewhere within DyNAMiC as <em>segments</em>)---continuous regions of complementarity.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> That is, rather than considering each distinct base pairing as a different secondary structure, reactions are only considered between longer regions of nucleotides. Pseudoknotted intermediates are not considered.</p>
<p>Once reactions have been enumerated, the enumerator can also generate a &quot;condensed&quot; network of reactions; this network groups all &quot;resting states&quot; (individual resting complexes or cycles of resting complexes connected by fast reactions), and shows only reactions between these resting states. Such a network helps visualize more complex reaction networks by occluding some detail.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-input-for-the-enumerator">Preparing input for the enumerator</h2>
<p>The enumerator accepts several text-based input formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Standard input format</em> (<code>.enum</code>) – This is a simple format that is specific to the enumerator. A simple example of the format is included below. The format has three types of statements:
<ul>
<li><code>domain</code> statements declare individual domains, as follows: <code>domain name : specification</code>, where:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> is the name of the domain (e.g. <code>a</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>th</code>, etc.)</li>
<li><code>specification</code> is either the length of the domain (e.g. a number of bases, or just <code>long</code> or <code>short</code>) or a sequence (e.g. <code>NNNNNNN</code> or <code>ATTACG</code> or even a mixture of specific and degenerate bases <code>AANATCY</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>strand</code> statements group domains into strands, as follows: <code>strand name : domains</code>, where:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> is the name of the strand</li>
<li><code>domains</code> is a space-separated list of domains</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>complex</code> statements group strands into complexes and assign them a secondary structure, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>complex name :
strands
structure</code></pre>
where:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> is the name of the complex</li>
<li><code>strands</code> is a space-separated list of strands</li>
<li><code>structure</code> is a domain-wise description of the structure in dot-parenthesis notation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="pil">Pepper Intermediate Language</a> (<code>.pil</code>) – PIL is a general-purpose format for describing domain-level secondary structures. See the <a href="pil">PIL</a> page for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Input files for the enumerator can also be generated automatically by the <a href="dil">graphical DIL editor</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the standard input format:</p>
<pre><code># This file describes the catalytically generated 3 arm junction
# described in Yin et. al. 2008

domain a : 6
domain b : 6
domain c : 6
domain x : 6
domain y : 6
domain z : 6

strand I : y* b* x* a*
strand A : a x b y z* c* y* b* x*
strand B : b y c z x* a* z* c* y*
strand C : c z a x y* b* x* a* z*

complex I :
I
....

complex A :
A
.(((..)))

complex B :
B
.(((..)))

complex C :
C
.(((..)))

complex ABC :
A B C
((((((((. + ))))((((. + )))))))).</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-the-enumerator">Running the enumerator</h2>
<p>Once <a href="files">an input file has been created</a>, you can use the &quot;Run enumerator&quot; button to invoke the enumerator. Click the arrow next to the button to select a specific input format or set advanced options:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/enum.png" alt="Run enumerator button and menu" /><p class="caption">Run enumerator button and menu</p>
</div>
<p>There are 6 output formats available; you may click any of these menu items to generate output in that format, which will open in a new window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphical results (ENJS) – produces a file which can be rendered into a graphical, interactive network by DyNAMiC and exported to SVG. This file is also a valid <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> file and may be suitable for consumption by other tools.</li>
<li>Pepper Intermediate Language (PIL) – produces a representation of the network, including reactions, in the <a href="pil">Pepper Intermediate Language</a></li>
<li>Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) – produces a list of simple reactions between chemical species</li>
<li>Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) – produces a representation using the Systems Biology Markup Language, an industry standard format for modeling biological and chemical networks. SBML can be consumed by a reaction simulator, such as <a href="http://www.copasi.org/">COPASI</a></li>
<li>Legacy – produces output in the format of Brian Wolfe's old enumerator</li>
<li>Graph (EPS) – produces an EPS file showing the reaction network, laid out using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following options may be set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Condense output – Check this box to generate the condensed version of the reaction graph. For the ENJS output format, both the condensed network and the full network of reactions will be viewable; for all other output formats, only the condensed network will be written.</li>
<li>Maximum complex size – Select a maximum number of complexes (beyond which the enumeration should be truncated); this allows systems e.g. with potentially infinite polymers to be enumerate in finite time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="viewing-enumeration-results">Viewing enumeration results</h2>
<p>Once enumeration is completed, results should open in a new tab automatically. For the text-based output formats (PIL, CRN, SBML, etc.), this tab will show a text editor. For the graphical output format (ENJS), you should see an interactive, graphical representation of the network:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/enum-results.png" alt="Graphical enumeration results" /><p class="caption">Graphical enumeration results</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Complexes are represented by rectangles, while reactions are represented by colored circles (<em>nodes</em>). Complexes and reactions are connected by grey lines (<em>links</em>). Complexes are colored and outlined colored to indicate whether they are initial, resting or transient.</li>
<li>You can grab and drag the white background to navigate, and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>Mouse-over a complex or reaction to view a description in a tooltip, and to highlight incoming and outgoing links; cool colors show incoming links, while warm colors show outgoing links.</li>
<li>Click a complex to show its secondary structure; double-click a complex name or a reaction node to view details of the complex or reaction (see <a href="#viewing-complex-and-reaction-details">below</a>)</li>
<li>Complexes, reactions, and lines may be dragged to re-arrange the graph for readability.</li>
<li>Resting states (groups of resting complexes) are outlined in grey</li>
</ul>
