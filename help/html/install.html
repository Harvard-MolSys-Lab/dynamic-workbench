<p>You should have recieved a Disk image (<code>.dmg</code> file) containing a few different items. If you follow the graphical instructions in the disk image, you'll be good. Here are the steps explicitly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mount the disk image by double-clicking it in Finder</li>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download</a> and install VirtualBox</li>
<li>Install the DyNAMiC Workbench Server Virtual Machine:
<ul>
<li>Launch VirtualBox</li>
<li>From VirtualBox, select &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Import Appliance...&quot;</li>
<li>Browse to the mounted disk image</li>
<li>Select the file <code>DyNAMiC Workbench Server (0.3.0).ova</code></li>
<li>Accept the license terms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Install the helper Applications
<ul>
<li>Drag and Drop the applications named &quot;Workbench Server&quot; (green icon) and &quot;DyNAMiC Workbench&quot; (red icon) to your &quot;Applications&quot; folder
<ul>
<li>&quot;DyNAMiC Workbench&quot; is a browser which you can use specifically for Workbench</li>
<li>&quot;Workbench Server&quot; is an application that helps you start and stop the server</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configure the shared folders
<ul>
<li>Launch the &quot;Workbench Server&quot; application from your Applications folder</li>
<li>In the Workbench Server application, from the &quot;Configure&quot; menu, select &quot;Virtual Machine Shared Folder...&quot;</li>
<li>Navigate to or create a folder on your machine where you would like the Workbench IDE to store your files.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Great! Now follow the instructions below under &quot;Starting Workbench&quot; to get the Workbench server running.</p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>You should have recieved a <code>.zip</code> file containing a few items. Follow these steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip the downloaded file.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download</a> and install VirtualBox</li>
<li>Launch Virtual Box</li>
<li>Select &quot;File&quot; &gt; &quot;Import Appliance...&quot;, click &quot;Choose&quot;, and navigate to the folder where you extracted the <code>.zip</code> file. Select &quot;workbench.ova.&quot;</li>
<li>Accept the license terms.</li>
<li>Configure the shared folders
<ul>
<li>From VirtualBox, select the newly imported VM, and click &quot;Settings.&quot;</li>
<li>From the window which opens, select &quot;Shared Folders.&quot;</li>
<li>In the list, you should see one shared folder labeled &quot;fileshare&quot;.
<ul>
<li>If you do not see this file, click the plus button to the right of the list. From the &quot;Folder Path dropdown, navigate to or create a folder on your machine where you would like the Workbench IDE to store your files. <strong>Regardless of the file you choose, enter &quot;fileshare&quot; under Folder Name, and make sure to check &quot;Auto-mount&quot;.</strong>'</li>
<li>If you do see this file, click the middle button (yellow circle: edit). From the &quot;Folder Path dropdown, navigate to or create a folder on your machine where you would like the Workbench IDE to store your files. Do not change the Folder Name. Make sure &quot;Auto-mount&quot; is checked.</li>
<li>Once you've created/setup this folder, but before you launch the virtual machine, create another directory within this folder called &quot;files&quot; (lowercase, no quotes); you can do this using Windows Explorer. You will not be able to create or upload files otherwise. <em>Do this before you create an account, as described below</em>.</li>

<h4 id="cannot-create-files-in-workbench">Cannot create files in Workbench</h4>
<p>Make sure you followed the last part of the installation instructions and created a folder called &quot;files&quot; within your shared folder. You can do this in Mac OS X using Finder. If you already created you account, but did not follow this step, you should also create a directory within &quot;files&quot; corresponding to the email address you used to sign up (e.g. if you signed up with &quot;demo.user@wyss.harvard&quot;, you should create a file with that name). This must be done while the Workbench virtual machine is not running.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Shut down the Workbench virtual machine</li>
<li>Launch VirtualBox from Applications &gt; VirtualBox</li>
<li>Select &quot;Preferences...&quot; from the &quot;VirtualBox&quot; menu</li>
<li>Select the &quot;Network&quot; tab</li>
<li>In the box under &quot;Host-only Networks,&quot; look for &quot;vboxnet0&quot;. If it's there already, proceed to the next step. If it doesn't appear, click the plus icon next to that box; &quot;vboxnet0&quot; should appear.</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>From the main VirtualBox window, select the DyNAMiC Workbench Server virtual machine, then click &quot;Settings&quot; from the toolbar.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Network&quot;</li>

<p>For some reason, VirtualBox doesn't always come with a &quot;host-only adapter&quot; configured. A &quot;host-only adaptor&quot; is a utility which VirtualBox uses to create a network that exists only between your &quot;host&quot; operating system and the DyNAMiC Workbench Server virtual machine.

<h4 id="vt-xamd-v-hardware-acceleration-has-been-enabled-but-is-not-operational.">VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is not operational.</h4>
<p>&quot;Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot. Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in the BIOS of your host computer.&quot;</p>
<p>Hardware virtualization is a feature on most modern processors which allows guest operating systems to directly utilize the processor on the host machine in a secure fashion. Additional information for the curious is <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#hwvirt">here</a> To enable hardware virtualization on your system, you need to configure it through the BIOS. The exact method of doing this depends on the manufacturer of your computer, but sample instructions are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dell systems
<ul>
<li>Depress the F12 key when boot menu text appears at startup</li>
<li>Select BIOS setup and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Using the mouse, expand the Virtualization Support menu item by clicking on the plus to the left of Virtualization Support and select Virtualization</li>
<li>Check the Enable Intel Virtualization Technology checkbox</li>
<li>Click Apply</li>
<li>Click Exit</li>
<li>Fully shut down (power off), wait a few seconds, and restart your computer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>HP systems
<ul>
<li>Depress Esc key when prompted at startup</li>
<li>Depress the F10 key to Configure BIOS</li>
<li>Scroll to System Configuration using the arrow keys</li>
<li>Select Virtualization Technology and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Select Enabled and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Depress the F10 key to save and exit</li>
<li>Select Yes and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Fully shut down (power off), wait a few seconds, and restart your computer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lenovo ThinkPad systems
<ul>
<li>Depress the blue ThinkVantage key when prompted at startup</li>
<li>Depress the F1 key to enter the BIOS setup utility</li>
<li>Using the arrow keys, scroll to Config and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Scroll to CPU and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Scroll to Intel® Virtualization Technology and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Select Enabled and depress the Enter key</li>
<li>Depress Enter key to continue</li>
<li>Depress F10 key to save and exit</li>
<li>Select Yes and depress the Enter key</li>
