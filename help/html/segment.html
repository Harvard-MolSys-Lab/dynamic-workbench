<p><em>Segments</em>, known elsewhere in the literature as <em>domains</em>, are contiguous regions of basewise complementarity. For instance, the following strand:</p>
<pre><code>AAAAA GGGG TTTT</code></pre>
<p>Might be considered to consist of three segments. Segment-level designs are often more convenient than behavioral or sequence-level designs.</p>
<p>Workbench has several facilities for handling systems at a segment level:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="dil">DyNAMiC Intermediate Language</a> is the result of compiling <a href="nodal">Nodal</a> systems using <a href="dynamic">DyNAMiC</a>. DIL features a sophisticated graphical editor, and can be exported to various sequence designers, as well as the <a href="enumerator">reaction enumerator</a>.</li>
<li><a href="pil">Pepper Intermediate Language</a> is the result of compiling a <a href="pepper">Pepper</a> system with the Pepper compiler.</li>
</ul>
