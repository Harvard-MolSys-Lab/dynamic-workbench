<p>Workbench includes several utilities for handling common tasks in DNA system design. You can access these utilities from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu in</p>

<p>Enter a base-wise secondary structure in dot-parenthesis notation. Click &quot;Preview&quot; to update the graphical preview. Use the &quot;View&quot; menu to select various view options. Use the buttons in the lower-left to convert the structure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dot-parenthesis notation</li>
<li>DU+ notation</li>
<li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) -- Exports the current view as an SVG file suitable for editing in programs like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secondary-structure-view-menu">Secondary Structure View Menu</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/view-menu.png" alt="Secondary Structure &quot;View&quot; menu" /><p class="caption">Secondary Structure &quot;View&quot; menu</p>
</div>
<p>Choose one of four coloring modes, and several additional options from the &quot;View&quot; menu.</p>
<p>There are four coloring modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segments -- Color the base bubbles, letters, or backbones based on the segment to which they belong</li>
<li>Domains -- Color the base bubbles, letters, or backbones based on the domain to which they belong</li>
<li>Strands -- Color the base bubbles, letters, or backbones based on the strand to which they belong</li>
<li>Base identity -- Color the base bubbles, letters, or backbones based on the identity of each nucleotide base</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the additional options (below), different features will be shown and colored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show bubbles -- tick to show each base as a colored circle, or &quot;bubble&quot; (with coloring determined by the mode)</li>
<li>Show base labels -- tick to show a letter indicating the base identity of each base.</li>
<li>Show base numbering -- tick to show numerical indices every 10 bases</li>
<li>Show segment labels -- tick to show colored labels indicating the location of each segment; these can help you see where segments are, even when the coloring mode is not set to &quot;segments&quot;</li>
<li>Show strand labels -- tick to show labels for each strand</li>
</ul>
<p>If &quot;Show bubbles&quot; is checked, the base bubbles will be colored. If &quot;Show bubbles&quot; is unchecked, but &quot;Show base labels&quot; is checked, the base letters will be colored. If both are unchecked, the backbone will be colored.</p>
<h2 id="sequence-threading-tool">Sequence Threading Tool</h2>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The sequence threading tool can be used to map a set of sequences on to a design. For instance, if you have the following sequences:</p>
<pre><code>1 : AATACAG
2 : CCATAG
3 : GGAATAC</code></pre>
<p>And you wish to arrange these segments into strands as follows:</p>
<pre><code>s1 : 1 2 3
s2 : 3* 2* 1*
s3 : 1 2 3 2*</code></pre>
<p>You could enter the sequences into the left pane, and the strand specifications (in the above format) into the right pane, then click &quot;Thread&quot; to view the full sequences below. Click &quot;Show Dethreaded&quot; to indicate the boundaries between segments in the final sequences shown below.</p>
