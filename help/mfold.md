Thermodynamic analysis with Mfold
=================================

Workbench provides facilities for easily starting analysis tasks on the [Mfold/UnaFold web server](http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/), operated by Michael Zuker & Nick Markham of the RNA Institute at the State University of New York at Albany. 

RNAfold dialogues can be opened from a few places in workbench:

-	Select *Tools* in the main toolbar atop Workbnech, then *Mfold*, then *QuikFold*
-	From within a [sequence editor](sequence-editor), select *Compute*, then *Calculate MFE*
