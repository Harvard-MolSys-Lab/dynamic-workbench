Sequence Design with Multisubjective
====================================

Multisubjective is a multi-paradigm sequence designer that combines the rapid iteration of heuristic designers such as [Web DD](dd) with the thermodynamic analysis capabilities of [NUPACK](nupack). 

Multisubjective (`.ms`) files can be generated using [DIL](dil). See [DIL](dil) for details.
