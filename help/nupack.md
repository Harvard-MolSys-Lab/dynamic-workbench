Thermodynamic analysis and sequence design with NUPACK
======================================================

Workbench provides facilities for easily starting analysis and sequence design tasks on the [NUPACK web server](http://www.nupack.org), operated by the Niles Pierce Lab at Caltech. 

NUPACK dialogues can be opened from a few places in workbench:

-	Select *Tools* in the main toolbar atop Workbnech, then *NUPACK*, then either *Analyze*, *Design*, or *Utilities*
-	From within a [sequence editor](sequence-editor), select *Compute*, then *Calculate Partition Function*

Thermodynamic Analysis
----------------------

Enter sequences in the main window, separated by newlines. If desired, [modify the advanced options](http://www.nupack.org/partition/info?page_name=new), and click "Analyze"

Sequence Design
---------------

Enter a [NUPACK multi-objective design script](http://www.nupack.org/design/demos), then click "Design"
