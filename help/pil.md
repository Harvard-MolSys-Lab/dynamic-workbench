Pepper Intermediate Language (PIL)
==================================

The Pepper Intermediate Language (PIL) allows concise description of segment-level systems. PIL files can be generated by the [Pepper](pepper) compiler, or by the [Nodal](nodal) compiler. PIL was developed by Shawn Ligocki, Chris Berlind, Joseph Schaeffer, and Erik Winfree. See their [whitepaper](/etc/papers/PIL_Spec.pdf) for full details.

PIL follows the basic constructions of the [Pepper](pepper) language, but disallows some features (sequence constraints, components, etc.)

Each PIL line should consist of a directive of one of the following forms:

-	`sequence <name> = <sequence>` -- declare a new domain
-	`strand <name> = <list of sequences and explicit constraints>` -- declare a strand comprised of domains
-	`structure <name> = <list of strands> : <secondary structure>` -- declare a complex comprised of several strands
-	`kinetic <input structures> -> <output structures>` -- declare a reaction between several structures

Additionally, PIL lines beginning with a `#` sign will be treated as whitespace.
