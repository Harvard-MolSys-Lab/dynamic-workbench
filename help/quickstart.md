Getting Started
===============

This document will get you started with Workbench as quickly as possible. For a more detailed introduction, see the [Overview](overview).


Setup
-----

**Note:** This part assumes you've already [installed](install) Workbench Server, or that you're using a hosted installation. If you didn't configure this server, you're on a hosted installation; go on to the next section. See the [server](server) page if you're confused.

Designing a Nodal System
------------------------

To design a system using the Nodal Abstraction described in [Yin et al., 2008](http://yin.hms.harvard.edu/people/yin.peng/paper/pathway/index.html):

1.	Create a new file
	-	Select "New" from the main menu bar
	-	Enter a filename, like "system.nodal" (you can omit the file extension)
	-	From the menu under "Create," select "Nodal System." Your new file should appear in the tree on the left (labeled "Files")
	-	Open the file by double-clicking on its name in the Files tres
2.	Add some nodes to the workspace
	-	Drag and drop motifs from the palatte labelled "Motifs" onto the main white area (the "Workspace"). Nodes can be renamed by clicking on the gray label
	 above.
	-	For a full reference of the different motifs, see [nodal systems](nodal).
3.	Connect nodes together
	-	To indicate complementarities, select the Complementarity tool (labeled "Connect"). Click and drag from output ports (circular) to input ports (triangular).
	-	You can delete complementarities by switching back to the pointer tool (arrow), and pressing the large red "X" 
4.	Build your project and send output to a sequence designer
	-	Select the "Build" tab, then click "Compile". You should see a bunch of output files appear in the files tree to the left:
		-	(nodal system name).txt: this is a serialized (textual) representation of the reaction graph you've just drawn
		-	(nodal system name).svg: a graphical representation of the strands necessary to implement your system
		-	(nodal system name).nupack: a script for the [NUPACK Multiobjective designer](http://nupack.org/design/new) to design sequences using 
		  [thermodynamic ensemble defect minimization](http://www.nupack.org/downloads/serve_public_file/jcc11b.pdf?type=pdf). 
		-	(nodal system name).domains: a file which will allow you to quickly and easily generate and optimize sequences stochastically in your browser, 
		  using the Molecular Systems lab's Web Domain Designer (Web DD).

Sequence design with Web DD
---------------------------

To design some sequences for the structure you've just described:

1.	Open the .domains file by double-clicking its name in the Files tree
2.	Click "Mutate" to begin optimizting the design. You'll see the individual domains being designed in the center pane, a schematic of the various construct strands in the "Structure" pane to the right, and a real-time visualization of the candidate sequences in the "Strands" pane below. You can pause the mutation and save any part of this view by clicking the "Save" button and selecting a file name.
	-	Mutate the design for a while
	-	Once you're satisfied with the score (lower is better), pause mutations by clicking the "Mutate" button again.
	-	Save your final strands by clicking "Save" in the "Strands" pane, and selecting a file (how about "system.seq").

[Read more](web-dd) about Web DD, or [Sequence design](sequence).

Thermodynamic analysis and simulation with NUPACK
-------------------------------------------------

To perform full physical model calculations using NUPACK on the sequences we've just designed:

1.	In the "Strands" pane within Web DD, select "Compute"
2.	Hover over "Pairwise MFE Complexes," then enter a file name and click "Run." You don't need to provide and extension, just a prefix, since NUPACK will generate lots of files, and Workbench will wrap them up in a "package" file for you.
3.	The Console should pop up, and a message should be displayed indicating that the NUPACK task is being run. Wait until you see a bunch more output (starting with "Permutation generation complete."). This will indicate that the task has completed. Your Files tree will also refresh.
4.	You should see a new file called (file name you entered earlier).package; double-click it to view the results, which may take a moment to load. You should see a list of the distinct strands analyzed, a graph of the minimum free energy (âˆ†G) for the various possible complexes, and a list of complexes ordered by concentration. Click one of these complexes in order to view the minimum free energy structure as a 2D visualization, an arc diagram, or a matrix visualization.
