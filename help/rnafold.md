Thermodynamic analysis with RNAfold
===================================

Workbench provides facilities for easily starting analysis tasks on the [RNAfold web server](http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi), operated by the Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI) at the University of Vienna. 

RNAfold dialogues can be opened from a few places in workbench:

-	Select *Tools* in the main toolbar atop Workbnech, then *Vienna RNA*, then *RNAfold Server*
-	From within a [sequence editor](sequence-editor), select *Compute*, then *Calculate Partition Function*

See [additional documentation from TBI](http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/help.html)
