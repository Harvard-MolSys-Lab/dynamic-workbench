Server Tools
============


Built-in server tools
---------------------

Workbench contains the following built-in server tools:

-	Nodal compiler (DyNAMiC)
-	Domain designer (DD)
-	Multisubjective sequence designer
-	[Vienna RNA Websuite](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/)
-	[NUPACK sequence design package](http://nupack.org/)


Task manager
------------

The Task Manager (accessed by "System" > "Tasks") from the main menu bar, can be used to view current tasks running on the server, and previous tasks during the present session. Currently, running tasks cannot be interrupted.

Developing server tools
