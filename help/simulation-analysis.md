## Thermodynamic analysis packages

### NUPACK partition function calculation
Uses Caltech's NUPACK web server to compute the minimum free energy secondary structure of a strand or set of strands. See help from Caltech [here](http://nupack.org/partition/info?page_name=new). [Read more](nupack) about NUPACK in DyNAMiC

### Mfold partition function calculation and MFE structure determination 
Uses the University of Albany's DINAMelt web server to compute the minimum free energy secondary structure and base pair probabilities. See help from University of Albany [here](http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/help-quickfold). [Read more](mfold) about Mfold in DyNAMiC
	
### Vienna RNAfold partition function calculation and MFE structure determination 
Uses TBI Vienna's RNAfold Websuite to compute the minimum free energy secondary structure of single DNA or RNA strands. See help from TBI [here](http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/help.html). [Read more](rnafold) about RNAfold in DyNAMiC
