.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAalifold
reads aligned RNA sequences from stdin or \fIfile.aln\fP and calculates
their minimum free energy (mfe) structure, partition function (pf) and base
pairing probability matrix. Currently, the input alignment has to be in
CLUSTAL format. It returns the mfe structure in bracket notation, its
energy, the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble and the frequency of
the mfe structure in the ensemble to stdout.  It also produces Postscript
files with plots of the resulting secondary structure graph ("alirna.ps")
and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix ("alidot.ps"). The file
"alifold.out" will contain a list of likely pairs sorted by credibility,
suitable for viewing  with "AliDot.pl". Be warned that output file will
overwrite any existing files of the same name.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI \-cv\  factor
Set the weight of the covariance term in the energy function to
\fIfactor\fP. Default is 1.
.TP
.BI \-nc\  factor
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in the covariance term of the
energy function to \fIfactor\fP. Default is 1.
.TP
.B \-E
Score pairs with endgaps same as gap-gap pairs.
.TP
.B \-mis
Output "most informative sequence" instead of simple consensus: For each
column of the alignment output the set of nucleotides with frequency greater
than average in IUPAC notation.
.TP
.B \-p
Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in
addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure
only. Additionally, the centroid structure is computed and printed out.
.TP
.BI \-MEA\  [gamma]
Calculate an MEA (maximum expected accuracy) structure. See RNAfold man
page for details. If gamma  is not specified a default of gamma=1 is used.
Using -MEA implies -p.
.TP
.B \-noLP
Avoid structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). In the mfe
case structures with lonely pairs are strictly forbidden. For partition
function folding this disallows pairs that can \fBonly\fP occur isolated.
Setting this option provides a significant speedup.
.TP
.B \-circ
Assume circular (instead of linear) RNA molecules.
.TP
.B \-color
Produce a colored version of the consensus structure plot "alirna.ps"
(default b&w only).
.TP
.B \-aln
Produce a colored and structure annotated alignment in PostScript format in
the file "aln.ps" in the current directory.
.TP
.BI \-s\  num
Compute a stochastic sample of \fInum\fP random structures chosen according
to their Boltzmann probability. See the -p option in RNAsubopt.
.TP
.BI \-se\  num
like \fB\-s\fP, but also print out the energy and probability of each
structure in the sample.
.TP
.BI \-R\  Ribosum_Matrix
use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal energy model. Matrices to
use should be 6x6 matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG, GC, GU, UA, UG.
.TP
.B \-r
use Ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is chosen according to the minimal
and maximal pairwise identities of the sequences in the file.
When using Ribosum scores, best benchmark results were achieved with
options -cv 0.6 -nc 0.5 (see above).
.TP
.B \-old
use old energy evaluation, treating gaps as characters.
.PP
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options should work as in RNAfold

If using \fB\-C\fP constraints will be read from stdin, the alignment
has to given as a file name on the command line.

.SH "CAVEATS"
Sequences are not weighted. If possible, do not mix very similar and
dissimilar sequences. Duplicate sequences, for example, can distort the
prediction.

The algorithm is a variant of the dynamic programming algorithms of
M. Zuker and P. Stiegler (mfe) and J.S. McCaskill (pf) adapted for sets of
aligned sequences with covariance information.
