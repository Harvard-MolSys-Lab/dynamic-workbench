[\-noCloseGU] [\-P\ \fIparamfile\fP] [\-nsp\ \fIpairs\fP]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAplfold
computes local pair probabilities for base pairs with a maximal span
of L. The probabilities are averaged over all windows of size L that
contain the base pair. For a sequence of length n and a window size of L the
algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is
practical to "scan" very large genomes for short stable RNA structures.

Output consists of a dot plot in postscript file, where the averaged pair probabilities
can easily be parsed and visually inspected.

The -u option makes i possible to compute the probability
that a stretch of x consequtive nucleotides is unpaired, which is useful
for predicting possible binding sites. Again this probability is averaged over all windows containing the region.
.TP
.B WARNING! Output format changed!!
.PP
The output is a plain text matrix containing on each line a position i
followed by the probability that i is unpaired, [i-1..i] is unpaired [i-2..i]
is unpaired and so on to the probability that [i-x+1..i] is unpaired.  
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-W winsize
Average pair probabilities over windows of size \fIwinsize\fP. Default 70.
.PP
.TP
.B \-L span
Allow only pairs (i,j) with j\-i<=span. Default winSize.
.PP 
.TP
.B \-c cutoff
Report only base pairs with an average probability > \fIcutoff\fP in the
dot plot; default=0.01.
.PP
.TP
.B \-o
Save memory by printing out everything during computation. Saves memory,
and is activated per default for sequences over 1M bp.
.PP 
.TP
.B \-u (width)
Compute the mean probability that regions of length 1 to \fIwidth\fP are
unpaired. Output is saved in a _lunp file. Default width is 31.
.PP 
.TP
.B \-O
toggles \fB\-u\fP option, output is switched from probabilities to their
logarithm, which are NOT exactly the mean energies needed to the respective
stretch of bases!
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-d\fP \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in
RNAfold.
