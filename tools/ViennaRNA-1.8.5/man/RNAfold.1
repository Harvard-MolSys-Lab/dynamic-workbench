.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAfold
reads RNA sequences from stdin, calculates their minimum free energy
(mfe) structure and prints to stdout the mfe structure in bracket
notation and its free energy. If the \-p option was given it also
computes the partition function (pf) and base pairing probability
matrix, and prints the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble, the
frequency of the mfe structure in the ensemble, and the ensemble
diversity to stdout.

It also produces PostScript files with plots of the resulting
secondary structure graph and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix.
The dot plot shows a matrix of squares with area proportional to the
pairing probability in the upper right half, and one square for each pair in
the minimum free energy structure in the lower left half. For each pair
i\-j with probability p>10E\-6 there is a line of the form
.br
i  j  sqrt(p)  ubox
.br
in the PostScript file, so that the pair probabilities can be easily
extracted.

Sequences are read in a simple text format where each sequence occupies
a single line. Each sequence may be preceded by a line of the form
.br
> name
.br
to assign a name to the sequence. If a name is given in the input
PostScript files "name_ss.ps" and "name_dp.ps" are produced for
the structure and dot plot, respectively. Otherwise the file names
default to rna.ps and dot.ps. Existing files of the same name will be
overwritten.
.br
The input format is similar to fasta except that even long sequences
may not be interrupted by line breaks, and the header lines are optional.
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-p
Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in
addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure
only. In addition to the MFE structure we print a coarse representation of
the pair probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by
the ensemble free energy, as well as the centroid structure derived from
the pair probabilities together with its free energy and distance to the
ensemble. Finally it prints the frequency of the mfe structure, and the
structural diversity (mean distance between the structures in the ensemble).
See the description of pf_fold() and mean_bp_dist() and centroid() in the
RNAlib documentation for details.
.br
Note that unless you also specify \-d2 or \-d0, the partition
function and mfe calculations will use a slightly different energy
model. See the discussion of dangling end options below.
.TP
.B \-p0
Calculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities,
saving about 50% in runtime. Prints the ensemble free energy \-kT ln(Z).
.TP
.B \-p2
In addition to pair probabilities compute stack probabilities, i.e. the
probability that a pair (i,j) and the immediately interior pair (i+1,j-1) are
formed simultaneously. A second postscript dot plot called "name_dp2.ps", or
"dot2.ps" (if the sequence does not have a name), is produced that contains
pair probabilities in the upper right half and stack probabilities in the
lower left.
.TP
.BI \-MEA\  [gamma]
Calculate an MEA (maximum expected accuracy) structure, where the expected
accuracy is computed from the pair probabilities: each base pair (i,j) gets
a score 2*gamma*p_ij and the score of an unpaired base is given by the
probability of not forming a pair. The parameter gamma tunes the importance
of correctly predicted pairs versus unpaired bases. Thus, for small values of
gamma the MEA structure will contain only pairs with very high probability. 
The default value is gamma=1.
Using -MEA implies -p for computing the pair probabilities.
.TP
.B \-C
Calculate structures subject to constraints.
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints
on the structure encoded with the symbols:
. (no constraint for this base)
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
x (the base is unpaired)
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
> (base i is paired with a base j<i)
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
With the exception of "|", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting
with the constraint. This is usually sufficient to enforce the constraint,
but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF
folding ignores constraints of type "|".
.TP
.B \-T\ \fItemp\fP
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of \fItemp\fP C. Default is 37C.
.TP
.B \-4
Do not include special stabilizing energies for certain tetra\-loops. Mostly
for testing.
.TP
.B \-d[0|1|2|3]
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases adjacent to helices in
free ends and multi\-loops: With (\-d1) only unpaired bases can
participate in at most one dangling end, this is the default for mfe
folding but unsupported for the partition function folding. With
\fB\-d2\fP this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for
the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the
default for partition function folding (\-p). \fB\-d\fP or \fB\-d0\fP
ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
.br
With \fB\-d3\fP mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices
in multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial
stacking of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works
only for mfe folding.
.br
Note that by default (as well as with \-d1 and \-d3) pf and mfe
folding treat dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to
\fB\-p\fR to ensure that both algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
.B \-noLP
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1).
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can
\fBonly\fP occur isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally
occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
.B \-noGU
Do not allow GU pairs.
.TP
.B \-noCloseGU
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices.
.TP
.B \-e\ \fI1|2\fP
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the artificial ABCD... alphabet,
where A pairs B, C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\-e 1) or AU
(\-e 2) pairs.
.TP
.B \-P\ \fI<paramfile>\fP
Read energy parameters from \fIparamfile\fP, instead of using the default
parameter set. A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
.B \-nsp  \fIpairs\fP
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs. \fIpairs\fP
is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If a the first
character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \-nsp \-GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
.B \-S\ \fIscale\fP
In the calculation of the pf use \fIscale\fP*mfe as an estimate for the
ensemble free energy (used to avoid overflows). The default is 1.07,
useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for long sequences.
.TP
.B \-circ
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA molecule.
.TP
.B \-noPS
Do not produce postscript drawing of the mfe structure.
