.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAup
calculates the thermodynamics of RNA-RNA interactions, by decomposing the
binding into two stages. (1) First the probability that a potential 
binding sites remains unpaired (equivalent to the free energy needed to open
the site) is computed. (2) Then this accessibility is combined with the
interaction energy
to obtain the total binding energy. All calculations are done by computing
partition functions over all possible conformations.   

.br
RNAup provides two different modes: By default RNAup computes accessibilities, 
in terms of the free energies needed to open a region (default length 4). It
prints the region of highest accessibility and its opening energy to stdout, 
opening energies for all other regions are written to a file.

.br
In interaction mode the interaction between two RNAs is calculated. It is
invoked if the input consists of two sequences concatenated with an "&", 
or if the options -X[pf] or -b are given. Unless the -b option is specified
RNAup assumes that the longer RNA is a structured target sequence
while the shorter one is an unstructured small RNA. 
.br
Additionally, for every position along the target sequence we write the best 
free energy of binding for an interaction that includes this position to the
the output file. 
Output to stdout consists of the location and free energy, dG, 
for the optimal region of interaction. The binding energy dG is also split into 
its components the interaction energy dGint and the opening energy dGu_l (and
possibly dGu_s for the shorter sequence).
.br
In addition we print the optimal interaction structure as computed by RNAduplex
for this region. Note that it can happen that the RNAduplex computed optimal 
interaction does not coincide with the optimal RNAup region. If the two 
predictions don't match the structure string is replaced by a run of "."
and a message is written to stderr.  
.br

Each sequence should be in 5' to 3' direction. If the sequence is preceded
by a line of the form 
.br 
> name
.br
the output file "name_ux_up.out" is produced, where the "x" in "ux" is the
value set by the -u option. Otherwise the file name defaults to
RNA_ux_up.out. The output is concatenated if a file with the same name exists.
.br

RNA sequences are read from stdin as strings of characters. White space and
newline within a sequence cause an error! Newline is used to separate
sequences. The program will continue to read new sequences until a line
consisting of the single character @ or an end of file condition is
encountered. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.B Options for calculation of free energies needed to open a region:
.TP
.B \-u \fIlen\fP
specifies the length (len) of the unstructured region in the output. The
default value is 4. The probability of being unpaired is plotted on the
right border of the unpaired region. You can specify up to 20
different length values:  use "-" to specify a range of continuous values (e.g. -u 4-8) or specify a list of comma separated values (e.g. -u 4,8,15).
.TP
.B \-c \fI"SHIME"\fP
by default only the full probability of being unpaired is
plotted. The -c option allows to get the different contributions (c) to the
probability of being unpaired: The full probability of being unpaired ("S")
is the sum of the probability of being unpaired in the exterior loop
("E"), within a hairpin loop ("H"), within an interior loop ("I") and within a
multiloop ("M"). Any combination of these letters may be given.
.TP
.B Options for calculation of interaction:
.TP
.B \-w \fIlen\fP
determines the maximal length of the region of interaction, the default 
is 25. 
.TP
.B \-b 
include the probability of unpaired regions in both (b) RNAs. By default
only the probability of being unpaired in the longer RNA (target) is used.
.TP 
.B \-5(\-3) \fIlen\fP
These options extend the region of interaction in the target by len 
residues to the 5' and 3' side, respectively. The underlying assumption is 
that it is favorable for an interaction if not only the direct region of 
contact is unpaired but also a few residues 5'and 3' of this region. 
.TP
.B \-Xp
set interaction mode. Pairwise (p) interaction is calculated: The first
sequence interacts with the 2nd, the third with the 4th etc. If -Xp is
selected two interacting sequences may be given in a single line
separated by "&" or each sequence may be given on an extra line.
.TP
.B \-Xf
set interaction mode. The interaction of each sequence with the first
one is calculated (e.g. interaction of one mRNA with many small RNAs). Each
sequence has to be given on an extra line.
.TP
.B \-target
use the first sequence in the input file as the target. No length check is done.
.TP
.B general options:
.TP
.B \-C
Calculate structures subject to constraints. Symbols ".", "x" and
the matching brackets "( )" work in boths modes as described in
\fBRNAfold\fP. Symbols "<" and ">" are solely used for the calculation of
unpaired regions. The "|" constrain works only in interaction mode, the
corresponding base has to be paired intermolecularily.
.TP
.B \-o
make no output file.

.PP
the \-noGU, \-noCloseGU, \-nsp, \-S, \-P, \-noLP, \-T, \-4, and \-d 
options work as in \fBRNAfold\fP, see there for description. 

.B output

.SH SAMPLE OUTPUT
.B Output to stdout:

In Interaction mode RNAup prints the most favorable interaction energy
between the two sequences to stdout. The most favorable interaction energy
(dG) depends on the position in the longer sequence (region [i,j]) and the
position in the shorter sequence (region[k,l]): dG[i,j;k,l].  dG[i,j;k,l] is the
largest contribution to dG[i,j] = sum_kl dG[i,j;k,l] which is given in the
output file: therefore dG[i,j;k,l] <= dG[i,j].

.B Output to file:
 
Output to file contains a header including date, the command line of the 
call to RNAup, length and names of the input sequence(s) followed 
by the sequence(s). The first sequence is the target sequence.
Printing of the header can be turned off using the -nh option.

The line directly after the header gives the column names for the output:

.MC3i
  position     dGu_l for -u 3      dGu_l for -u 4       dG
.br
#     pos      u3S       u3H       u4S       u4H        dG 
.DE

where all information refers to the target sequence. The dGu_l column contains 
information about the -u value (u=3 or u=4) and the contribution to the free 
energy to open all structures "S" or only hairpin loops "H", see option -c.
NA means that no results is possible (e.g. column u3S row 2: no region of 
length 3 ending at position 2 exists).
