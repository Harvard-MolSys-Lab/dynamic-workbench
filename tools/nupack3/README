This is NUPACK 3.0

NUPACK (Nucleic Acid Package) is a growing software suite for the
analysis and design of nucleic acids.  The package currently enables
thermodynamic analysis at the level of nucleic acid secondary
structure for multiple interacting strands (without pseudoknots) or a
single strand (with or without a class of pseudoknots). The package
also enables design of a single complex of unpseudoknotted interacting
strands.

The NUPACK 3.0 User Guide is in doc/nupack_user_guide.pdf.  Please
consult that document for instructions for compilation and use of
NUPACK.

Please direct any questions, concerns, comments, or bug reports to
support@nupack.org.
